```

## Environment Setup

API keys, connection details such as strings and regions are set via environment variables.  They may either be set in system environment variables or via the .env file.  An example .env file is provided in the .env_example file.  To create the .env file copy the .env_example file and edit the values.

## Start the server

```bash
python server.py 
```

The server is then started. Open `http://localhost:5000` in browser. If you use F12 to view the Network you can see the WebSocket connection is established.

## Start the main app

Run:

```bash
source ./env/bin/activate
python main.py
```

The main app should use your system's default microphone.  Start speaking messages and you can see the messages are translated and transferred to the browser.
